# WindTurbine_Failure_Prediction_EnsembleMethods_HyperparamterTuning
This project predicts wind turbine failures using numerous sensor data by applying classification based ML models that improves prediction by tuning model hyper parameters and addressing class imbalance through over and under sampling data. Final model is productionized using a data pipeline
